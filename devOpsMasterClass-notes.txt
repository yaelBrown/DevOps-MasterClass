dev ops notes

dev ops - is a cultural and behavior shift to remove silos

configuration drift 
jenkins and gitlab ci 

ci - act of merging code and testing it as much as possible
cd (delivery) - code in the main branch is deployable to production at any time
  button you are pressing works everytime without fail, whenever you need it. 
  all aspects of the application should be tested. 
cd (deployment) - every change is deployed to the production environment automatically with no human intervention
  enables faster feedback loops, and faster delivery of value
  change is small generally small
  usually not implemented
ci (improvement) - aims to improve software delivery with incremental improvements
  a/b testing is used

Mean time to Change - how long does it take from the inception of a new fix, feature, or other chang to the point when it's delivered to production
deployment frequency - how often code is released to production
deployment lead time - how long does it take from the moment a change is approved for release to the point the change is in production
mean time to recover - time it takes from failure to recovery

A delivery time must introduce at least one change to improve a key metric in every sprint

rauncher (PaaS) - 

devops teacher team - coaching and mentoring should be the primary objectives of a devops specialist

Delivery team autonomy - teams can work minimal external dependencies

kubernetes is a google native google cloud applications
  leading container orchestration platform
